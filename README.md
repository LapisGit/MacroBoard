# MacroBoard

## Features:
- 6 Keys
- Customizable config without having to change the firmware (technically)
- USB-C
- Powered by a XIAO-RP2040

## CAD:

My case was made using **AutoDesk Fusion Personal.** I started out with making the bottom of the case, and then the top, and that ended in a faliure. So I went ahead and redesigned the entire board, including the PCB and wound up with this!

## PCB:

My PCB was made in KiCad 9, and I decided to add some personal *flair* to the PCB, aswell as the Hack Club logo for *obvious* reasons.
